# SRT to VTT converter

Convert SubRip format subtitles to WebVTT format subtitles.

Either use convertOnline.php?srt=filename.srt or on the command line use `php convertFiles.php input.srt [output.vtt]`. If no output file provided then will be written to stdout.

Syntax liable to change. This is merely a minor update to and publishing of code I wrote in 2017.
